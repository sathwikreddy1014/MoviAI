# MoviAI
# Project Setup
Before starting the project, create a .env file in the project root and add your API keys:

REACT_APP_TMDB_KEY=your_tmdb_api_key

REACT_APP_OPENAI_KEY=your_openai_api_key

# A brief description of the project
MoviAI is a Movie-Library, Netflix-style movie discovery app built with React, React Router, Tailwind CSS, and Redux Toolkit. It integrates TMDB for real-time movie data and OpenAI for GPT-powered search suggestions. Users can browse now playing, top rated, trending, and upcoming lists, and watch autoplaying/muted trailers.

# Set up and run locally (Windows)
Install Git on your desktop if it isnâ€™t already installed.
Open the GitHub repository and copy the HTTPS clone URL.
Open Terminal or Command Prompt.
Navigate to the directory where you want the project:
Use dir to list folders.
Use cd foldername to enter the desired folder.
Clone the repository:
git clone <paste-https-url-here>
Open the project in VS Code:
code .
In VS Code, open a new terminal.
Install dependencies:
npm install
Start the app:
npm start
The app will run at http://localhost:3000.

# Running tests
This project uses Jest and React Testing Library for unit and integration tests. Test files are placed alongside corresponding components and slices (e.g., Wishlist.test.js).

Install test dependencies:

npm install --save-dev @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom @testing-library/user-event

Run all tests:

npm test


# Assumptions and design choices
TMDB is the source of truth for movie metadata, artwork, and categorizations (now playing, top rated, trending, upcoming).

OpenAI GPT is used for natural-language movie queries and suggestions; final movie details are resolved via TMDB.

React + Redux Toolkit provides centralized, predictable state management (movies, wishlist, GPT suggestions).

React Router is used for clean navigation and route-based organization.

Tailwind CSS enables fast, responsive UI development.

Environment variables are used for API keys and are not committed to version control.

Authentication note: I previously implemented login and logout using Firebase, but removed the feature since it was not part of the project requirements.
